Daydream is an interactive screensaver mode that starts when a userâ€™s device is docked or charging.

Those feature were added:
* Show unread Gmail Notification (if you have any in your Inbox)
* Show unread SMS Notification
* Show missed call Notification

Tip: Search your Gmail for "is:unread" to display any unread email. 

To enable this screensaver go to Setings->Display->DayDream and select Clock plus. If you have it set in "when to daydream" menu and have your phone in the charger/dock it will not turn off its screen but displays this screensaver instead
